An alternative to the "classic" example Todo App by [Jérôme Gravel-Niquet](https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone/tree/master/examples/todos) and later [Addy Osmani](https://github.com/addyosmani/todomvc/tree/master/todo-example/backbone).

## Use
Run **./webserver.sh** to get past Access-Control-Allow-Origin policy.

## Architecture
The app is based on backbone.js treating Views as app modules that send notifications handled by an internal Mediator pattern. If the different js files were loaded using AMD, it would represent an example of Addy Osmani`s [Patterns For Large-Scale JavaScript Application Architecture](http://addyosmani.com/largescalejavascript) approach.

###  Modules
The modules do not communicate between each other, only talk to the Model and trigger notifications. They are:

- **CreateTodoView** that represents the input field for new tasks
- **TodoListView** that creates a list of...
- **TodoView** items
- and when these items are updated, **TodoStatsView** is updated

##  Documentation
Look into the *doc* folder for a split comments-code view generated by pycco.

##  Future
This app will be updated as my understanding of JS apps increases through active use at work. These will be definitely added:

1. AMD
2. Unit tests

##  Rants
Oh and I believe Views should be called Presenters.
